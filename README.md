# Dyson-DC33-Vacuum-cleaner-refurbishment
Engineers' log and technical drawings for this refurbishment project. 

Well, how not to repair a vacumm cleaner? You remember those BBC documentries where an engineer is called to an old dears' house and changes everything, orders way too many spare parts, it may as well be a new vacumm cleaner, well this is what I did here, opps. I was very scared by the amount of smoke, smell of burning rubber and exposed wire form the worn out flex. But I Ended up changing the main motor! At a very high cost. All that required was a cleaning of the motor with 

Air dusters (Air in a spray can)
Contact cleaner

Pre and post motor filters, the old one had burnt through the middle, which is where the smell came from. Seals, because the dirt was getting sucked into the motor, new flex, new drive belt (Which is not a timing belt) and a new rotor, brush all whch can be purchased via the Dyson website. Oh and the smell was not the clutch either, which I think was working perfectly, I still decided to do some 'mindfullness' therapy and draw the clutch pad. 

So what I learnt form this was never be scared of the smell and smoke, it is probably not the electric motor or the clutch but rubber and combustible filters. Remember the clutch is controlled by the centrafugal forces not some angury person getting the hovering done quickly.
